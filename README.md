# Manual-Text-Annotation
Inspired by https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano, this app is an attempt to build a useful tool that supports human annotation for sentiment analytics in the MERN (Mongodb-Express-Reactjs-Nodejs) stack way.It is also my internship's project from which i learned a lot not just absorbing languages but also paying attention to the program's structure and keeping my code as clean as possible.Here is all my knowledge i gained from this experience.I decided to share it as a way to revise myself and hopefully, you find it helpful.
